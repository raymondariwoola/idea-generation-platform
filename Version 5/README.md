    siteUrl: 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite', // Update this
    listName: 'InnovationIdeas',
    libraryName: 'IdeaAttachments',
    maxFileSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB
    allowedFileTypes: ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx', '.txt'],
    // ... other settings
};
```

### Current User Configuration
Update the `currentUser` object with actual user details:

```javascript
this.currentUser = {
    name: _spPageContextInfo.userDisplayName,
    department: 'Engineering', // Get from user profile
    email: _spPageContextInfo.userEmail,
    id: _spPageContextInfo.userId
};
```

## Deployment

## Security Considerations

- **Read**: All employees can view ideas
- **Contribute**: All employees can submit ideas
- **Manage**: Innovation team can advance status

### Data Privacy
- Anonymous submissions supported
- Email addresses stored securely
- Files accessible only to authorized users

### CORS and Authentication
The application uses SharePoint's built-in authentication and CORS policies.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- IE11+ (with polyfills)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Customization

### Theming
Update CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --brand-primary: #6ae3ff; /* Your primary color */
    --brand-secondary: #9b8cff; /* Your secondary color */
    /* ... other theme variables */
}
```

### Categories and Impact Types
Update the choice columns in SharePoint and corresponding JavaScript arrays.

### File Type Restrictions
Modify `allowedFileTypes` and `allowedMimeTypes` in the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure SharePoint allows cross-origin requests
2. **Permission Denied**: Check user permissions on lists and libraries
3. **File Upload Fails**: Verify file size and type restrictions
4. **List Not Found**: Ensure SharePoint lists are created correctly

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging by setting:
```javascript
console.log('ðŸš€ Innovation Portal V5 initialized with SharePoint integration');
```
